# Speech-to-Text
Azure Text to Speech Program:

Currently this system utilizes the following libraries:
- azure.cognitiveservices.speech
    - AudioConfig
    - ResultReason
- thread
- pynput
    - keyboard
- time

To set up correctly, you will need to export your api_key and region in the terminal. Looks like this;
export api_key='your_actual_key'
export region='your_actual_region'

Still work that needs to be done. Lots of debugging, but we're getting there!
